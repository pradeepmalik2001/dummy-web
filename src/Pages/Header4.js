          </h3>
          <p>
        Ozone is a chemical compound consisting of three oxygen atoms O3 (ie triatomic oxygen), a highly energetic form of normal (diatomic) atmospheric oxygen (O2). Thus, the molecules of these two forms are different in structure. Due to its being an extremely powerful oxidizing agent and a highly effective disinfectant, it is used throughout the world to destroy germs in water treatment installations supplying drinking water.

          <h3>Hyperthermia - Therapeutic Fever</h3>
          <p>
          “I would cure all diseases if I only could produce fever.” Parmenides, Greek physician and philosopher, 510 BC
          Fever and heat therapy have been recognized for their beneficial effects on health since antiquity. Traditionally there have been two forms of hyperthermia—whole body and localized applications. We are now discussing the modern innovations to both approaches of hyperthermia, as applied in the treatment of cancer. Fever turns out to be one of the missing links in understanding cancer. Most cancer patients have a lower core temperature and cannot mount a fever. Thus they are unable to activate their immune system.

          <h3>Immune therapies in the treatment of cancer</h3>
          <p>
          In the Gorter Model, a full range of immune therapies are used to treat cancer patients.
Although fever therapy and dendritic cell vaccinations are the primary forms of treatment, there are also several other complementary therapies that are incorporated, depending on the needs of the individual.
The main goals of these innovative immune therapies are to restore and maximize immune function. The other goal is to destroy cancer cells without introducing toxic agents that can have a negative impact on immune function and on patient’s quality of life.
